          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I am a senior at New York University Tandon School of Engineering pursuing a B.S.
            in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics, Economics, and Game Engineering. I grew up
            in the Bay Area, California where I was fortunate enough to have access to some of the newest
            technology. I came to New York because I wanted to see how other people view and interact with
            technology.

          <h3>Wearable Technology VIP</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently part of the Wearable Technology VIP team at Tandon where we are looking at ways
            to monitor anxiety levels using noninvasive sensors to track biomarkers. I have created a Processing sketch
            to visualize current values received by the sensors. I also helped to build an infrared sensor
            which detects how much light is reflected back by the blood in a person's wrist. This value reflects
            when a heartbeat is sensed and can be used to determine blood glucose levels.

          <h3>Senior Design</h3>
          <p>
            For our Senior Design project, we are building a multi-platform application to connect people who want
            to learn a language with someone who is fluent in the language. This project is to be completed during
            the Fall 2019 semester.
